This C++ utility class provides a C++ api for building up hierarchical 
data that may be passed to or from BrowserPlus services.  The largest
difficulting in writing native services is the type munging that must occur.
This utility provides a convenient c++ API for accessing and populating
data, while representing the data in memory in the structures defined in
the C BrowserPlus API.

Additionally, this directory contains tools for version parsing, and in
memory representation of a service description.  These tools will be of
most interest to authors of interpreter or 'provider' services, such
as the RubyInterpreter service.  Python anyone?  Javascript?

Getting Started:

Build the sample and check out the code.

(looking for a contributed visual studio build file :))
